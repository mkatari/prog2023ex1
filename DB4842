# Write a function that takes two lists representing sets (with no duplicates) which returns a list of the intersection.
# (use only loops and sequence indexing with no method calls except append).
# Use a nested loop in your implementation. Test on the list A = [2, 4, 5, 6] and B = [4, 6, 7, 8].
#

  intersection_list = []
  for i in list1:
