# Write a function that takes two lists representing sets (with no duplicates) which returns a list of the intersection.
# (use only loops and sequence indexing with no method calls except append).
# Use a nested loop in your implementation. Test on the list A = [2, 4, 5, 6] and B = [4, 6, 7, 8].
#
A = A = [2, 4, 5, 6] 
B = [4, 6, 7, 8]

def intersection(list1, list2):
    lst = [value for value in list1 if value in list2]
